  The object is intended to be used solely as a context manager and not
  as a general purpose object.

  The timer starts when __enter__ is invoked on the context manager
  and stopped when __exit__ is invoked. After __exit__ is called,
  the duration properties report the amount of time between
  __enter__ and __exit__ and thus do not change. However, if any of the
  duration properties are called between the call to __enter__ and __exit__,
  then they will return the "live" value of the timer.

  If the same Timer object is re-used in multiple with statements, the values
  reported will reflect the latest call. Do not use the same Timer object in
  nested with blocks with the same Timer context manager.

  Example usage:
